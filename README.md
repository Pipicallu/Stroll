# Stroll 

The web app that allows users to share walking and cycling routes throughout London. The concept of this app came about to help people find ways to stay active and keep healthy and mentally sound throughout lockdown. With more and more people finding themselves in isolatio, The idea of a site that would allow users to share information over a common passtime would foster the idea of both community and healthy mental practice whilst keeping people engaged throughout a global pandemic.
