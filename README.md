# Stroll 

The web app that allows users to share their favourite walking routes all over the world! The concept of this app came about to help people find a new way to stay active, aswell as to keep healthy and mentally sound throughout the COVID crisis. With more and more people finding themselves in isolation and lockdowns becoming increasingly frequent, The idea of a site that would allow users to share information about one of the world's most common passtimes could foster the idea of both community and healthy mental practice whilst keeping people engaged throughout a global pandemic.

## An Overview of : The Why?

This project came from a very personal place. As a foreign national living overseas and now in my 10th year abroad. It is safe to say that I have had a fair share of experience, away from my home and my family. But after making my way through two national lockdowns and facing a third, I knew I wanted to set out and make a web application, that was both intuitive and culturally relevant, something that ultimately could be of help to not just me personally but more importantly others like me. In other words I wanted to fullfill a genuine need. It got me thinking of the things that we are missing as a society in this post COVID era day to day and one of which that most stood out to me was the absence of being able to take a walk down the street, to the park, round the block and feeling as though you were surrounded by humanity. So I set out to bring that feeling of community in the everyday 15-20 min walk to the user and just like that I decided to make stroll. 


## User Goal
To appeal to trekkers and lovers of walking all over and allow them to share walking routes and journies with others and discover new ones in their own local area. 
## Secondary user goals

to make friends and foster a community through self isolation.
## Site Owner Goal

The site owner is in this case also a user who ideally shares an equal passion for walking, The site owner is socially conscious and would like to use this site to promote his own line of products that he will sell amongst the community in order to raise money for covid research or other topical causes
